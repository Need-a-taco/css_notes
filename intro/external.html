<!--
    This is the same styling as the internal CSS, except that we have
    relocated the code to a CSS file called external.css. We can just copy
    and paste everything between the style tags. We dedicate external.css
    to the style of this file, external.html. Normally, the naming conventions
    are index.html and style.css. 

    Note that in external.html, we have to establish that our external.css
    file, which we should generally keep in the same directory, is the
    stylesheet for our file. To do this, we add a link tag in the head of
    the document, add "rel=stylesheet" to establish that the relation of
    the following file with the current is that of a stylesheet. Then, we
    add external.css according to its file path relative to external.html
    as the href attribute. Now, we are done. 

    However, what if we want to create different styles for different paragraphs
    or same types of html, while still using internal or external CSS. This
    is where id and class attributes come in. Id is generally used for unique
    styling, while class is used to apply a style to many html tags. However,
    if you want you can use either interchangeably when it comes to styling. 

    Id is usually used for implementing Javascript functions for web functionality,
    but that's a topic for another day. 

    Also, this is outlined in the CSS file too, but I'll write it here: note the
    syntax when defining ids and classes. Notice that for ids, we use the hashtag
    before the id name to indicate that we are about to define an id. Then for
    classes, we use a period before to indicate we are about to define a class.
